\title{leaflet.extras: Extra Functionality for 'leaflet' Package.}
\description{
The 'leaflet' JavaScript library provides many plugins some of which
are available in the core 'leaflet' package, but there are many more. It is not
possible to support them all in the core 'leaflet' package. This package serves
as an add-on to the 'leaflet' package by providing extra functionality via 'leaflet'
plugins.
